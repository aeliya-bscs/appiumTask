steps :
1. I cloned the repository on VS Code installed npm.
2. Removed .example from env file extension and update variable and save
3. Started expo and that launch emulator (installed on my machine)
4. Performed testing and execute testcases on that emulator
5. Created apk using expo dev account.
6. Now using eclipse created a project, added dependencies
7. Started appium server and inspector locate variables and write automation scripts (I believe there are some issues that I am unable to resolve due to my system configuration. Currently, I have only 8 GB of RAM, which is causing my laptop to crash whenever I run emulator alongside the Appium server. However, I've outlined my approach in the class file, which you can view in base.java and mainClass.java)

- You need to Clone this repo in eclipse, run your android emulator and appium server, update capabilites as per your device and run it
