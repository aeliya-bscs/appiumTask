steps :
1. I cloned the repository on VS Code installed npm.
2. remove .example from env file extension and update variable and save
3. start expo and that launch emulator (installed on my machine)
4. write and execute testcases on that emulator
5. create apk using expo dev account.
6. now using eclipse created a project, added dependencies
7. started appium server and inspector locate variables and write automation scripts (I believe there are some issues that I am unable to resolve due to my system configuration. Currently, I have only 8 GB of RAM, which is causing my laptop to crash whenever I run emulator alongside the Appium server. However, I've outlined my approach in the class file, which you can view in base.java and mainClass.java)
